I have heard every complaint, every bitch and every moan. I should have a PhD in clinical psychology from the thousands of hours of emotional counseling I\'ve done. The one excuse I cannot condone, the one that makes my blood boil, is when an athlete says something absurd like, &ldquo;I forgot to eat lunch today.&rdquo;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>You forgot to eat? You forgot?? To EAT??!!!</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Nothing makes me want to punch an athlete in the face more than that phrase. If you are adhering to any kind of rigorous training program your diet should be your first priority. Make a plan and stick to it. Nothing will hinder progress in the gym more than poor dietary planning.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Routine is key. Don\'t go to bed on Monday night until you have cooked enough food to cover Monday night\'s dinner and at the very least all of Tuesday\'s meals. Tuesday\'s meals are prepared and packaged in portable containers. Have your protein powder and shaker prepped and ready. There should never be a time during the day that you are starving. There should always be a protein-rich meal close by.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>You need to have a plan for every contingency. For example: It\'s late Monday morning at your office. You are feeling good because you ate a half-dozen eggs and a half-pound of grass-fed beef for breakfast. You are equally proud of your mid-morning protein shake and the one you have ready for later this afternoon. You have planned well. Your dietary needs are covered.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>But wait! What\'s this? It appears as though some douchebag from your office has eaten your mid-day meal. Clearly this asshole did not plan ahead and that\'s why the thickest part of his legs are his wobbly knees.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Not to worry. You have planned for just this eventuality. In the trunk of your car there is a bag. In that bag you will find a large tub of protein powder, a large sack of almonds and a huge jar of peanut butter. There are a few bottles of water and a shaker. There might also be some ninja throwing stars or a club of some kind. After you\'ve cleaned your coworker&rsquo;s blood from your hands, you can enjoy an impromptu tailgate party as you prepare your protein shake in the parking lot.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>It\'s also important to enjoy your life. Don\'t let your diet or lifestyle interfere with your quality of life. There will be parties and dinners. The savage and savvy planner will call ahead to a restaurant to make sure there\'s a steak on the menu. If there\'s no high-protein option, he will plan accordingly by bringing a pre-made meal and consume it in the car before his dinner date. Inside he will enjoy a salad and quinoa loaf and still manage to be social despite the lack of flesh on the menu.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>So don\'t tell me you forgot to eat. Don\'t tell me you don\'t have time. Make the time. Make a plan. Be ready for anything. Have enough pre-made, protein rich meals in containers to cover your day. Have a back-up plan like a backup-bag. Always have enough healthy food on hand to make sure you are never hungry.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Plan ahead.

The inability to squat well and comfortably makes everything in weightlifting impossible.<br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately, dialing in your squat if it&rsquo;s not something that comes naturally to you is not an easy process. Not only do you have to learn the motor skills involved with the movement, which seem quite simple until you have trouble with them, but you need to develop mobility and stability throughout the body.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let&rsquo;s see if we can sort you out.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Finding Your Stance</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />The first step is to determine you squatting stance&mdash;the width of your feet and the degree to which your toes are turned out (if you believe the ultimate goal for all athletes is to be able to squat with the toes forward, please take a break from this article and <a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/article/113/Proper-Foot-Position-in-the-Squat/">read this one</a> first).<br />&nbsp;<br />Each athlete&rsquo;s ideal stance will be individual based on anatomical peculiarities such as hip and femur anatomy and relative upper and lower leg length. Fortunately, we can prescribe some very simple criteria to ensuring whatever stance you use is mechanically sound.<br />&nbsp;<br />To find your stance easily, place your heels slightly wider than hip width, turn your toes out a little, and sit casually into the bottom of a squat, not worrying about your back or any details like that&mdash;sit down and relax like you&rsquo;re going to smoke a few non-filtered Lucky Strikes here.<br />&nbsp;<br />All you need to do now is adjust the width of your feet and how much your toes are turned until you&rsquo;re in a position in which:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your feet are flat on the floor.</li>\r\n<li>Your hips are comfortable, i.e. no pinching or pressure&mdash;find a position in which the hips move the most freely.</li>\r\n<li>Each thigh is approximately parallel with the corresponding foot&mdash;if you look straight down from above one thigh, your foot is in line with it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThere you go. This is the position that will allow your hips to move through the plane in which they&rsquo;re most mobile, and keep your knees aligned so they hinge as intended rather than get exposed to rotation.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img class="articleBodyImage" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/dialSquat/dialSquat-findStanceThighFoot.jpg" /><br /><span class="articleCaption">To find your stance, sit down and relax in the bottom of a squat and adjust your feet until your position meets the criteria described (left). The squat stance should allow the foot and corresponding thigh to be approximately parallel with each other to ensure the knee hinges without twisting (right).</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><img class="articleBodyImage" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/dialSquat/dialSquat-toeAngles.jpg" /><br /><span class="articleCaption">Toe out will generally be about 20-30 degrees relative to the centerline between the feet, but it is possible for somewhat more or less to be &ldquo;correct&rdquo; for a given athlete.</span><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Exceptions: </strong>If you have serious mobility limitations, you&rsquo;re going to have trouble finding this position because nothing is going to feel totally right. Find a stance that aligns each foot with the corresponding thigh and makes your hips the least uncomfortable and you&rsquo;ll refine it over time as you improve your mobility. Be cautious to not toe-out to an extreme degree to compensate for limited mobility.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Controlling Your Trunk</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />As with any loaded lifting movement, trunk rigidity with the proper spinal position in the squat is critical for both safety and performance. We&rsquo;re looking for neutral or slightly exaggerated lumbar lordosis (arch or extension) and minimized thoracic kyphosis (the natural forward curvature of the upper back). The combination of these two things will effectively create a single continuous arch of the length of the spine. This position needs to be supported and locked in with pressurization of the trunk and forceful muscular activation around the circumference of the trunk, as well as the top and bottom (diaphragm and pelvic floor).<br />&nbsp;<br />Relax your abs and take in the deepest breath you can, imagining filling the lungs from the bottom to the top&mdash;let your entire trunk expand from the abs to the chest, forward, backward and to the sides. Once you have this breath, lock it in at your throat and squeeze every muscle around your trunk to cinch down around that air and increase the pressure. Do NOT try to suck your waist in&mdash;imagine pushing your abs down, and this will typically help you achieve a forceful contraction without losing the breadth of your trunk, which we want to maintain. (<a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/article/37/Breathing-and-Breath-Control-for-Olympic-Weightlifting/">See more about breathing and trunk pressurization here</a>.) Create your back arch and start squatting.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you have trouble creating or maintaining the proper back arch, there are two possibilities&mdash;your hip and ankle mobility need work (see the next heading), or your ability to activate your spinal extensors needs work. You may also have limited thoracic spine mobility, which limits your ability to flatten your upper back and makes the creation and maintenance of the complete back arch more difficult.<br />&nbsp;<br />To help improve your back extension control, isolate back extension. You can do this in a glute-ham bench, or lying prone on the floor. In either case, curl your back up to lift your head and chest as high as you can (glutes tight)&mdash;feel that forceful contraction from the base of your skull to the top of your butt. Once you have a feel for that, relax the arch, tighten your abs to bring your ribs flat (i.e. not protruding forward), and then arch your back again. This will help you get the sensation of arching the entire length of your back rather than simply folding backward at your thoraco-lumbar junction, and help avoid extreme hyperextension. It&rsquo;s OK to exaggerate the extension here&mdash;in fact, that&rsquo;s what we want. Arch as far as you can to get the feeling&mdash;try to touch your upper back to your butt cheeks&mdash;you won&rsquo;t arch this much when you&rsquo;re actually lifting. You can do this in your warm-up before you squat and in between squat sets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, if your thoracic extension/flattening is limited, make it better. The back extension practice above will help with this to some degree IF you actually try to extend your upper back like you should. It may help to put your hands behind your head, or reach the arms forward and then lift them up as high as possible as you extend.<br />&nbsp;<br />For general T-spine mobility, I still prefer the good ol&rsquo; foam roller even though apparently it&rsquo;s not cool anymore. The key is to roll or extend over the roller properly&mdash;just like we don&rsquo;t want to fold over at the TL junction when we extend the spine, we don&rsquo;t want to do it when foam rolling the T-spine because that means we&rsquo;re not actually mobilizing the T-spine, but simply reinforcing an already hypermobile joint area.<br />&nbsp;<br />The easiest way to do this is to keep tension on your abs and attempt to keep your back flat as you roll up and down the T-spine. We&rsquo;re not really trying to arch the back around the roller here, but get some movement of the thoracic vertebrae in relation to their neighbors.<br />&nbsp;<br />After rolling, you can do some static holds over the roller by reach your arms up overhead and trying to relax around the roller&mdash;but keep your abs tight and ribs flat so the movement is confined to the T-spine where it should be. Keep in mind that if this is done properly, you&rsquo;re not going to see a significant arch or much movement at all&mdash;that&rsquo;s fine, because the movement is where it should be.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Settling into the Bottom Position</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Full depth in a squat in the context of weightlifting is very simple: the knee joint closed as completely as possible with the spine still properly arched and the weight balanced across the whole foot (a relaxed spine will allow you to sink a little deeper, but we&rsquo;re not relaxing that thing when squatting because we&rsquo;re not idiots). Anything less than that is not full depth, and don&rsquo;t bother arguing about it&mdash;just get better at squatting so you have more to offer the world (note that depth can appear very different among individuals based on proportions even if <em>full</em> by my definition).<br />&nbsp;<br />The bottom position, like the stance, is simple:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Feet flat with the weight balanced across their length with a very slight preference for the heel if possible.</li>\r\n<li>Head up and eyes forward. The ground isn&rsquo;t going anywhere, and if it is, your squat is the least of your concerns.</li>\r\n<li>Back extended from the top of your butt to the base of your skull with neutral or very slightly exaggerated lumbar extension.</li>\r\n<li>Knees closed so the upper and lower legs are stacked on top of each other.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor mobility improvement, the spiderman lunge (or, if you prefer, the non-gender-specific spider person lunge) and squatting ankle stretch will give you the most effect for your investment of time and effort. Do these stretches in your warm-up and between every set of squats in your workout&hellip; and every other spare moment you have.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you alternate the spiderman lunge with the superman hold described under the previous heading, you get what I call the <a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/article/1708/The-Superhero-Complex-Stretch-Activate-Easily-for-Squats/">superhero complex</a>, and that will make it more enjoyable.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img class="articleBodyImage" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/dialSquat/dialSquat-stretches.jpg" /><br /><span class="articleCaption">The spiderman lunge and squatting ankle stretch will give you the most effect for your investment in improving hip and ankle mobility for the squat.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Refining Your Movement</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, even if you have a good bottom position, you can mess up the movement between it and the top of the squat.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let me just clear this up quickly: if your bottom position is correct, whatever happens between the top and bottom is not a mobility issue. I see people talking about limited mobility when a lifter&rsquo;s knees dive in through the middle of a squat, and yet in the bottom position, the knees/thighs are exactly where they need to be. Does this lifter suddenly lose flexibility in the middle of each squat? Of course not&mdash;so stop confusing people.<br />&nbsp;<br />We want to sit directly down and stand directly up&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want our butts detouring 3 feet backward on each rep. The hips will move back somewhat because they have to, but we want to remain as upright as possible as we squat and stand.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img class="articleBodyImage" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/dialSquat/dialSquat-hipPath.jpg" /><br /><span class="articleCaption">The hips will move back somewhat because they have to, but we want to remain as upright as possible as we squat and stand.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />This requires you be strong in exactly the way that supports this movement and posture. If you&rsquo;ve always squatted by sitting back and leaning over, and/or you&rsquo;ve always deadlifted and pulled from the floor with high hips, you&rsquo;re going to struggle to do this with any kind of load.<br />&nbsp;<br />The forward tip in a squat&mdash;hips moving back, chest moving forward, and hips shooting up faster than the chest/bar initially&mdash;happens when there is not enough quad strength relative to posterior chain strength, which is the natural result of training with the type of squat and pull I just described. The only solution is to retrain your body until it has the proper balance of strength to maintain the posture you want with more weight.<br />&nbsp;<br />First, make sure the majority of your squatting volume is done with the proper posture and movement&mdash;this means do more reps and sets below the weight threshold after which your position goes to hell. You can still squat heavy and imperfectly, just limit those exposures relative to the good ones.<br />&nbsp;<br />Next, throw some pause squats into your program. These will not only help prevent tipping from uncontrolled bounces out of the bottom and by allowing you to focus on and control the movement better, but will help strengthen the bottommost range of motion properly, which is where the unwanted tipping occurs&mdash;the body tries to get the knee joint more open as soon as possible to give the quads better leverage. Front squats will get even more quad in there, but pause back squats will be very helpful, especially since you&rsquo;ll want to tip even more in your back squats.<br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, while you&rsquo;re working to refine this motion, remember that a slow but properly positioned squat is superior to a fast but improperly positioned squat. Doing it right is going to feel slower and more difficult initially&mdash;you&rsquo;re weak in that position, plain and simple. You&rsquo;ll feel faster doing it wrong for two reasons&mdash;you&rsquo;re stronger that way, so it may actually be a little faster; more likely it&rsquo;s an illusion, however&mdash;your hips shoot up quickly, which is the speed you feel, but the bar lags behind, meaning it&rsquo;s actually going slower. Have the discipline to fight for the correct position even when it feels awful because that&rsquo;s the only way it&rsquo;s ever going to stop feeling awful eventually.<br />&nbsp;<br />I would be remiss if I neglected to mention the valgus knees, knees-out, hip torque clusterfuck. In short, the thigh and corresponding foot should remain in line with each other throughout a squat. This means the knees are above the feet&mdash;not inside, and not outside. If the knees are collapsing in, you can push them out&mdash;until they&rsquo;re in line with the feet where they should be. If your knees are in line with your feet already, quit thinking so much and just stand up because everything is cool.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you have wiggly, spastic knees in the squat, it would be a good idea to throw in some unilateral leg work for some hip stability such as lunges, step-ups (actually done with the up leg, not by pushing off the down leg), even 1-legged RDLs if you&rsquo;re feeling fancy. Mainly, when you&rsquo;re accumulating all of your good reps in training, focus on maintaining constant tension throughout your legs and hips as you squat and keeping the knees moving along the line of the feet so your body is naturally trained to do it.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you want more info on this topic and a touch of vitriol, <a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/article/1826/Squatting-Valgus-Knees-The-Knees-Out-Cue-Facebook-Coaches/">read this</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>It Takes Time</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Make every squat rep you do count toward improvement, and invest the necessary time and effort into whatever additional work is necessary, such as stretching (or <em>mobilizing</em> as I guess we&rsquo;re supposed to say now). Like reading this article, which is about 7 times longer than I intended, developing a great squat if you don&rsquo;t have one naturally takes some time, but is possible and will be well worth the time and effort.</div>', 9, '2016-12-05', '2116-12-06', 1, 0),

Some of these make sense and some guidelines can be provided, but others vary too much to really provide useful numbers. The primary ones I\'m talking about here are things like hang or block snatches and cleans relative to the full lifts.<br /><br />Generally speaking, we would expect a hang or block lift to be less than a lift from the floor - this makes sense intuitively: less time and distance to accelerate the barbell upward should mean that an athlete can\'t lift as much.<br /><br />However, in a decent number of cases, even with fairly high level lifters, a partial lift from the hang, or in particular the blocks, can exceed the lifter\'s best from the floor. This can be for a number of reasons, but typically it indicates a problem with the lift from the floor, such as poor or inconsistent positioning, postural weakness in the early pull, incorrect speed or rhythm, etc. A certain block position (usually at the knee or right below the knee) puts the lifter in the perfect position and eliminates the problems normally created in the pull prior to this position.<br /><br />While it may be indicative of a problem, it\'s not the end of the world and you don\'t need to completely rewrite your or your lifter\'s training program. Take advantage of their ability to do well in a certain hang or block position by keeping it in their training program - this is still good training for the lift, and in particular will help with confidence. Further, athlete\'s enjoy the lifts they\'re best at, and enjoying training makes lifters successful.<br /><br />However, also use this situation to help diagnose the problem that\'s causing this unusual ratio and adjust the rest of the training program to address it. This will often mean the addition of certain pull or deadlift variations, snatch or clean complexes that include pulls before the lift, and technique primers focusing on the pull from the floor.</div>', 4, '2016-12-04', '2116-12-06', 3, 0),

I don&rsquo;t wear them when snatching. The support of neoprene sleeves is great when you&rsquo;re squatting or jerking, but they cause me problems by deviating my fibular head, so I limit their use. Mike Gray said it best when he likened the thick blue Rheband knees sleeves to that one ex-girlfriend you know you shouldn&rsquo;t call but you can&rsquo;t help it. So what I do is this: for competition or when I really want to push the squat, clean or jerk, I will use the <a href="http://www.jackalsgym.com/store.aspx?prod_id=RH-KS">blue Rheband knee sleeves</a>. For training days when I&rsquo;m feeling beat up and need a little help but my knees feel fine, I will throw on the thinner <a href="http://www.jackalsgym.com/store.aspx?prod_id=RH-KS2">gray Rehband sleeves</a> that aren&rsquo;t too tight. And for the majority of my training, I use some thin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K312LS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">McDavid elastic sleeves</a> whose purpose for me is just making the Sombra on my knees get hot (they don&rsquo;t provide any support). I like this system as it keeps my knees feeling good, and I get a little boost in competition or max lifting when I add the bit of rebound that comes with the thicker Rehband sleeves.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Belt</strong> I use a <a href="http://www.andreascahling.com/4inchbodybuildingbelt.aspx">Valeo belt</a> with the plastic cam buckle. These things are lightweight but strong, conform well to your body, and are freely adjustable unlike a traditional buckle that has preset holes. They&rsquo;re pretty cheap too, but durable&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been using the same one for 5 or 6 years.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Straps</strong> I use homemade straps that are 1&rdquo; nylon because they allow me to snatch without restricted hand and wrist movement. We will be offering straps for sale shortly modeled after these.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Tape &amp; Related</strong> I almost always tape my thumbs when snatching and cleaning. I use <a href="http://www.findtape.com/product377/Jaybird+Mais-4600-Jaylastic-Select-Premium-Lightweight-Athletic-Stretch-Tape.aspx?idx=3&amp;tid=2&amp;info=stretch%2bathletic%2btape">elastic tape</a> (2&rdquo;) made by Jaybird-Mais. For non-thumb-taping needs, I use a <a href="http://www.findtape.com/product250/Jaybird+Mais-EX1-Jaybird-One-Premium-Non-Elastic-Athletic-Tape.aspx?idx=2&amp;tid=2&amp;info=elastic%2bathletic%2btape">standard athletic tape</a> (2&rdquo;) also by Jaybird-Mais. I also use <a href="http://www.tite-grip.com/buynow.html">Tite-Grip</a> to keep my hands dry in order to keep my thumb tape sticking well.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Liniment</strong> I have used a number of different liniments, and I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.sombrausa.com/warm-therapy">Sombra</a>. The trick is that you need to be sweaty for it to really get hot (hence the thin knee sleeves mentioned above). Outside of training, I like good old <a href="http://www.icyhot.com/pagecream.html">Icy Hot</a> (actually the <a href="http://shop.riteaid.com/dp/B0030HKO3I#.UeVwRFO-7a8">generic version</a> from RiteAid that smells like Wint-o-green Lifesavers) to slather on any areas that are bothering me. For cold only, <a href="http://www.biofreeze.com/">Bio-freeze</a> is good.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Compression Shorts</strong> I use <a href="http://bkathletics.net/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage_images.tpl&amp;product_id=81&amp;category_id=1&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=72">BodyScience compression shorts</a> when I train, and at night, I sometimes wear the <a href="http://bkathletics.net/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage_images.tpl&amp;product_id=68&amp;category_id=1&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=72">BSC compression pants</a> for a couple hours after a rough training day following a dip in the hot tub and/or ice bath. I will say that these things are made for emo butts, but it appears that all other brands are too. So I can&rsquo;t train in the long pants without them being halfway down my ass each time I move, and I&rsquo;ve blown out the asses of two pairs during squat workouts. The shorts have held up just fine in training, however, and these are what I wear under my singlet in competition.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Barbells &amp; Weights</strong> We use <a href="http://www.werksanusa.com/">Werksan</a> barbells and plates at Catalyst Athletics. We do have a collection of other barbells, but these are specifically for squatting and other rack work.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Other </strong>I like inhaling noxious fumes before a big lift, and lately I have been using <a href="http://www.prowriststraps.com/inc/sdetail/24525/84960">Nose Tork</a> ammonia. I do suggest covering the bottle with some athletic tape, though, so any leaking won&rsquo;t make the outside slick.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Supplements</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Most of the supplements I take are for help with sleeping, but a few aren&rsquo;t. Here&rsquo;s the list:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Energy</strong> <a href="http://www.advocare.com/products/active/A2094.aspx">Advocare Spark</a> is good stuff, fairly tasty, and gets me pumped to lift well without making me feel strung out. This is especially true if I&rsquo;m keeping my daily caffeine intake minimal or nothing outside of Spark.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Creatine</strong> I use <a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=29&amp;products_id=400">Podium Gold powder</a>, which is actually creatine and beta-alanine. This is the only creatine product I&rsquo;ve used in over 15 years that I can actually feel make a difference. I do 5 g before training and 5 after.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Fish Oil</strong> I use <a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=29&amp;products_id=667">PurePharma capsules</a>. 3 with breakfast and 3 with dinner.

These lifters passed their tests in &rsquo;08 and &rsquo;12, but now they&rsquo;ve been retested, popped, and kicked out of the sport. That means they&rsquo;re out of the Rio Olympics, unless some kind of legal action happens in the coming months that overturns their suspensions. That might happen, but for now, these lifters are suspended from competing in weightlifting (several Olympic gold medalists, including Ilya Ilin, are in this pack).<br />&nbsp;<br />People are losing their minds over this nuclear news explosion. The fans of the suspended lifters are losing their minds with disappointment and shock. The IWF kicked their butts up between their shoulder blades, and now there&rsquo;s much weeping and gnashing of teeth. The drug-free lifters and coaches in the sport are losing their minds with glee and hope. The weightlifting gods have dabbed a little soothing ointment on the stinging pain that goes along with being a clean athlete in a dirty sport.<br />&nbsp;<br />However&hellip; everybody is a little worried, regardless of which side of the drug issue they fall on. We&rsquo;re worried about the entire sport of weightlifting getting kicked out of the Olympic Games. Is the International Olympic Committee finally going to get fed up with all the nasty drug scandals that come from weightlifting? We know the image of the Olympics is massively important to the IOC, and steroid controversies are the public relations equivalent of somebody taking a dump on the living room floor during a dinner party. The powers-that-be don&rsquo;t like it when the sacred Olympic Games gets made to look like a drug circus, and weightlifting is one of the sports that does that exact thing fairly often.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let me describe it by sticking with the dinner party analogy I started. Imagine the Olympics is a dinner party, and all the guests at the party represent different sports. Got it? Some of the guests at the party have oodles of money and fame (basketball, figure skating, etc.), so they stroll around with an air of superiority and security. They sip brandy from diamond-studded snifters (with their pinky fingers sticking straight out), knowing they&rsquo;re the stars of the show with their sexy clothes and perfect tans. Weightlifting is like the obnoxious guest who eats off other people&rsquo;s plates without permission, gets drunk, rips farts at the table, and eventually staggers up to the rich guests with disheveled hair and shirt half untucked, teetering back and forth and slurring out, &ldquo;Hey basketball, you think you&rsquo;re better than ME? I&rsquo;ll put my FIST up your ASS!&rdquo; The sports nobody cares about (ice curling, rhythmic gymnastics) try to defuse the situation and calm weightlifting down, preferring a nice mellow party that&rsquo;s as boring as they are. The other wacko sports that are almost as obnoxious as weightlifting (wrestling, boxing) stand back and encourage the fight with shouts of, &ldquo;Yeah weightlifting! Beat the PISS out of basketball!&rdquo; while the sports that are purely devious and sneaky (cycling, track and field) use the fight as a distraction so they can creep around the house and steal stuff.<br />&nbsp;<br />The hosts of the party have tolerated weightlifting&rsquo;s behavior for a long time. Despite all the mortifying social habits, the hosts (the IOC) don&rsquo;t truly want to get rid of weightlifting, at the end of the day. If they did, they would have chucked us years ago. They know we&rsquo;re pretty badass and even though we don&rsquo;t have gargantuan mainstream popularity, lots of people like us. So they just choose to keep us at the party and hope we don&rsquo;t ever truly cross the line and throw synchronized swimming through a window or something.<br />&nbsp;<br />Are we reaching that point now? Is this current drug scandal (and the obvious additional scandals that could arise) enough to break the camel&rsquo;s back? Is the IOC truly considering removing Olympic weightlifting from the Olympic Games?<br />&nbsp;<br />It&rsquo;s definitely possible. Back in 1988, there was an extremely nasty drug shenanigan at the Olympics with the Bulgarian weightlifting team. You old timers remember that one? Bulgaria had to yank their whole squad halfway through the competition because they were getting popped all over the place and they knew it would continue if they stayed on the platform. In other words, our sport was giving a nice fat black eye to the Games. Thank god Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive and drew 100% of the galaxy&rsquo;s attention to track and field, leaving the IOC with much bigger things to worry about than lousy old weightlifting. That might have been just enough to save our bacon.<br />&nbsp;<br />But how long can it go on? Like many organizations, the IOC&rsquo;s primary interest is money. Sports that bring in revenue are usually going to be safer than sports that don&rsquo;t. Weightlifting isn&rsquo;t one of the most profitable sports at the Olympics, so&hellip; that&rsquo;s not good. However, weightlifting is a globally popular sport (Yes, American sports fans, there&rsquo;s a great big world out there where LeBron James isn&rsquo;t the most important human being in existence). We&rsquo;ve also got the longstanding tradition of being one of the oldest sports in the Olympics, which maybe gives us just a smidgen of security.<br />&nbsp;<br />But who knows if those things are enough? Longstanding tradition didn&rsquo;t help wrestling much, as we saw a few years ago. And if weightlifting eventually finds itself in a situation where the disgraceful scandals outweigh any positives the sport produces, what happens then?<br />&nbsp;<br />Everybody knows we&rsquo;re not the only dirty sport in the world. Most people know we&rsquo;re just one of many sports that involve drug use. However, our sport doesn&rsquo;t produce millions of dollars that we can use to deflect the bullet, like track and field does. Trust me people, we&rsquo;re in a very vulnerable position these days. The juicers and juice supporters might just get us all lined up in front of a firing squad.<br />&nbsp;<br />I hope this doesn&rsquo;t happen. This sport is one of the foundations of my whole life, just like many of you. And no matter what anybody says, we don&rsquo;t want to lose our place in the Olympics.<br />&nbsp;<br />Keep your fingers crossed.</div>', 39, '2016-12-02', '2116-12-06', 6, 0),

The old &ldquo;lifting weights makes women look bad&rdquo; mentality has been tossed in the trash where it belongs, and record numbers of ladies are dedicating themselves to the sport. Some of them are exceptionally talented. This is where Stephanie Palacol&rsquo;s name comes into the conversation.<br />&nbsp;<br />I met Stephanie (or &ldquo;Stevie&rdquo; to many of us) a few years ago, almost right when she started in weightlifting. It didn&rsquo;t take a genius to see this gal was blessed with some tools to move up the ladder quickly. In just a little under three years of focused training, she won the silver medal at the 2014 American Open with a 80 kg snatch (176 lbs.) and 100 kg C&amp;J (220 lbs.) in the 58 kg weight class (128 lbs.). Stevie has already broken into the upper levels of our national rankings, and her potential to go higher is plain to see.<br />&nbsp;<br />And like so many American weightlifters, she&rsquo;s currently &ldquo;living the life&rdquo; of trying to balance her job demands and training schedule. Lifters don&rsquo;t have it easy in our US system (or lack of a system, actually), but Stevie is determined to plow through the obstacles on her way to continued success in the sport. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the life of this rising star.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>Tell us about your background. Where are you from, where do you currently live, what&rsquo;s your occupation, family life, what kind of sports background do you have outside of lifting,<br />Etc.</strong></em><br />&nbsp;<br />I was born and raised in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. I lived there until I was 18, then moved to Flagstaff, Arizona to attend college. I currently live in Charlotte, North Carolina with my boyfriend Brett Nenaber and my two rescue pups Tank and Tonka. My profession is athletic training. I work for Carolinas Healthcare System as an athletic trainer, serving local high schools in the area. My family still lives in Hawaii and run the family restaurant, Quinn&rsquo;s Almost by the Sea. As a child, I was always involved in sports. I played volleyball and soccer in high school. In college, I found a love for the weight room, but never though about lifting competitively. All I wanted to do was get strong. I did not start weightlifting until June 2012.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>Describe your weightlifting history. When/how did you start? Who have your coaches been? What are your proudest accomplishments?</strong></em><br />&nbsp;<br />There is not much of a history to explain. I started lifting in June 2012. My boyfriend Brett started adding Olympic lifts into my programs. After noticing that I was pretty good at these movements, I decided to enter my first competition in August 2012 at East Valley CrossFit. This is where my love for weightlifting began. At this first competition I qualified for the 2012 American Open. My first competition total was 129, snatch 52k and clean and jerk 77k. At the 2014 American Open, I ended up 2nd overall with a competition total of 180. I owe my success in the sport to my Coach Brett and my weightlifting family at East Valley CrossFit. During my time at EVCF, I was able to train with Alex Lee and was able to be coached by Shahin Nasiri Nia. I hope to have the opportunity to train with these two amazing people again.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><em>Please give a basic description of your training method. Just tell us as much as you can about your program, weekly/yearly planning, etc.</em></strong><br />&nbsp;<br />In a year, I usually complete three 16-week training periods. Each cycle is four weeks long, so have four cycles every period. The first cycle is usually high volume and moderate intensity to build muscular endurance. The second cycle is a strength phase with moderate volume and moderate intensity and third is a strength-power phase (my favorite). The last cycle is usually a competition cycle that will prepare me for a big competition. During this cycle, I max every week to prepare physically and mentally for competition. I only train four to five days a week, due to working a full time job. Four days a week I will complete a clean and snatch variation and I squat three days a week. My training sessions are usually one and a half to two hours long and I train in my home.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>Describe some of the obstacles you face, or maybe some things that frustrate you in your weightlifting life. What kinds of changes would you like to see, either personally or with the sport in general?</strong></em><br />&nbsp;<br />The obstacle that I currently face is training alone. After leaving the environment at EVCF, it has been hard to find anything like that out here in Charlotte, North Carolina. Lifting alone has caused me to have low motivation and I find myself losing love for the sport. Another obstacle is working a full time job that has late hours. In my weight class, I am competing against many women who have been training over five years to a decade. They have the upper hand, having so much competition experience. I hope I can find a job that will allow me to train more, thus allowing me to become more competitive in my weight class.<br />&nbsp;<br />This sport is so beautiful and I hope that more people have the honor to be a part of it in their lifetime. CrossFit has done a great job bringing light to the sport, but we still have so far to go. I would love to see more AAU clubs created around the nation that will bring the sport to the youth. Most youth are performing a variation of Olympic lifts with their high school sports teams. I believe it is our duty as ambassadors of the sport to donate our time and teach these students the correct technique and educate them.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>What are your plans and goals for your weightlifting career? How do you see your future in the sport?</strong></em><br />&nbsp;<br />My goal is to qualify for a world team. I still have a ways to go, but I believe that I have the drive and ability to do so. Since I have only been lifting for two and a half years, my body is strong and healthy and I have no history of serious injury. I see myself competing in weightlifting for a long time.<br />&nbsp;<br />Who are some of your major influences, people you look up to, etc.? Who are the people you want to thank for your success?<br />My major influences in the sport are Alex Lee and Morghan King. For those of you who have had the opportunity to watch Alex lift, you know why I look up to him. He is a technician and embodies the meaning of speed and power. As for Morghan, she is amazing. Only a few years after dedicating all of her training to weightlifting, she became an American superstar of the sport. She has competed on multiple world teams and has shown all of us it is possible even if you have not been lifting forever. Both she and Alex are training at the Olympic Training Center. I can only hope to be able to train at the OTC with them.<br />&nbsp;<br />First, I would like to thank Brett for providing me with the best programming that fits my life and the time constraints I have. Thank you, August Schmidt for giving me a home to lift in while living in Arizona. Also, thank you to everyone who I have ever lifted with at EVCF and for those who have cheered me on at the local meets held there. Thank you Iron Athlete Weightlifting team for being my long distance motivation. And last but not least, thank you to my sponsors Iron Athlete and Gnarly Nutrition.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>You have a hell of an opportunity in front of you, Stevie. Keep banging away and don&rsquo;t quit, because your potential to leave a big mark on this sport is ready and waiting. Gracias for sharing your life with our Performance Menu family!&nbsp;</strong></em></div>', 43, '2016-12-04', '2116-12-06', 4, 0);

(12, 1, 'Understanding Sleep for Optimal Recovery & Productivity', '<div class="article_page_article_image"><img class="article_image" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/2014-04-14-cooperSleep.jpg" alt="Image from http://www.alongside.me/human-improvement/human-improvement-mind/triphasic-sleep/" /></div>\r\n<div id="article_content">Sleep is the most important part of recovery when it comes to illness, depression, stress and especially training. In regards to weightlifting, without quality sleep, weightlifters cannot properly recover and reach their full potential. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions about sleep and sleep cycles, so hopefully this article will clarify a few things so you will be able to get the most out of your sleep, which will result in optimal training.<br /><br />As seen in the included graph, there are several different stages of sleep: Stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and REM. Most people seem to think that a typical sleep cycle consists of only one cycle through the stages. As you can see in the image above, the stages of sleep actually cycle throughout the night depending on the duration of asleep. <br /><br />When you initially go to sleep, you soon dip into stage 1. Over the next hour, the body will go into deeper sleep until it reaches stage 4. As stage 4 ends, you will transition out of the deepest part of sleep and reverse back into the lighter stages until you hit REM. REM occurs about 2 hours after initially falling asleep. Some people think that REM sleep is the deepest period of sleep, but as you can see in the diagram, stage 4 is actually the deepest period of sleep and REM is the closest to being awake the body will be in the sleep cycle. While REM is where most of your dreaming takes place, it is actually the period of sleep where you are closest to being awake.<br /><br />The body typically goes into stage 4 only two times in a full 8-hour sleep cycle. After two full cycles of stage 1-REM sleep, the body will cut out stage 4. After three cycles, the body will cut out stage 3. The body will continue to go through two cycles of stage 2 and REM before you awake naturally.<br /><br />If you are not getting 8 hours of sleep per night, you are not completing the cycles of sleep and thus not optimizing your recovery. It is impossible to overcome sleep deprivation through any other recovery method. If something helps, the results are merely temporary. In an ideal world, 8 hours of sleep would be a regular occurrence and there would be no need for sleep studies and articles because everyone would be getting enough rest for recovery. In a fast-paced world filled with work, family and other obligations, sleep isn&rsquo;t always a priority. <br /><br />Most weightlifters in this country have things other than weightlifting in their lives, such as careers and families to support. They may work a typical 8am-5pm job, participate in family activities, and eventually train in the remaining hours left in the day. In most cases like this, a person is very unlikely to get in a full sleep cycle of 8 hours. <br /><br />There are some things to take into consideration if you absolutely cannot get a full 8 hours of sleep per night. Often times we set our alarms to go off at the last possible moment so that we can wake up and still make it to work on time. It makes sense to us to do this. More sleep = better sleep, right? 5 hours and 35 minutes must be better than 5 hours and 5 minutes. In actuality, quantity of sleep may <em>not</em> be optimal for your sleep cycle and productivity if you are getting less than the full 8 recommended hours.<br /><br />The least optimal period of sleep to wake up during is stage 4. Stage 4 is the deepest period of sleep and if you wake up out of stage 4, you are likely to be disoriented, groggy, and even have a headache. An example might be on a night where your house alarm goes off and you wake up out of a deep sleep with a headache and it takes a few minutes to figure out where you are and what&rsquo;s happening. The pattern follows from least to most optimal to wake up is stage 4, 3, 2, 1, REM (stage 1 and REM being the most ideal stages during which to wake up). The deeper the period of sleep you are in when your alarm goes off, the more groggy, disoriented and less productive you will be that day.<br /><br />When you wake up out of deep periods of sleep continuously, you are subconsciously telling your body that you no longer need deep periods of sleep. Sleep disorders are likely to occur because of this. If you are regularly able to wake up during the lighter periods of sleep, productivity is higher and you will find yourself much more alert and feeling well-rested throughout the day. <br /><br />For instance, if you only had 5 total hours to sleep, it would be more ideal to wake up at the end of the REM cycle which should occur at only 4 hours 15 minutes than to wake up at any point between 4 hours 15 minutes and 5 hours since your body will be in a deeper stage of sleep in that final 45 minutes. Another thing to realize is that the first 4 hours of sleep is where most of the deep sleep happens. As the sleep cycle continues, you will spend less time in deeper periods of sleep and more time in REM sleep. <br /><br />So, of what use is this information? This is a weightlifting website and this is an article about sleeping. My suggestion is that if you know you will not be getting a full 8 hours of sleep, you should utilize the sleep stage chart and set your alarm for a time that gives you a good chance to wake up in a lighter period of sleep, even if that means you will get less total sleep. You will find that you will feel more refreshed and be more productive. Training (and other aspects of your life) will go better if you wake up in the proper part of your sleep cycle.<br /><br />Products are continuously being developed regarding this subject. Eventually, you will be able to purchase a product that allows you to set a time interval and it will know when during that time interval is most optimal to wake you up. These are called smart alarms or sleep cycle alarms. Until then, you have the most control over your sleep intervals. A simple sleep chart and proper planning may make the difference in how you train and recover to the best of your ability. Give it a try and the results may surprise you. <br /><br />Sleep well, eat well, and train hard!</div>', 23, '2016-12-05', '2116-12-06', 2, 0),

(16, 1, 'Switching to Weightlifting Shoes: Why You Should & What to Expect', '<div class="article_page_article_image"><img class="article_image" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/2016-11-21-switchLiftingShoes.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div id="article_content">When I started giving seminars 10 years ago, out of an average 30-person group, maybe 5-10 would have weightlifting shoes. These days, I may get 1-2 people at each seminar who don&rsquo;t wear weightlifting shoes. My point is that in the last few years, familiarity with weightlifting has improved, but probably more importantly, the availability of weightlifting shoes has increased dramatically and training in weightlifting shoes isn&rsquo;t such a weird thing that only a handful of hardcore lifters do anymore.<br />&nbsp;<br />That said, there is still resistance among non-competitive weightlifters to wearing weightlifting shoes, even when training the snatch, clean &amp; jerk and related lifts for the sake of getting better at the snatch and clean &amp; jerk. If we&rsquo;re being totally honest, I find this odd for a number of reasons&mdash;it&rsquo;s no different to me than playing football and refusing to wear cleats, or playing baseball and refusing to wear a glove. I&rsquo;ve heard all kinds of fascinating rationales, my favorite of which is that weightlifting shoes aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;natural&rdquo;&hellip; neither are barbells, rubberized plates, lifting platforms, or any of the other things you <em>are</em> using to train weightlifting. If you want to be natural, go lift rocks barefoot out in the dirt with your gens in the breeze&mdash;at least that makes sense.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let me make a simple case for shoes even if you&rsquo;re not a competitive weightlifter:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>They will help you achieve positions/postures optimal for the snatch and clean &amp; jerk, i.e. a very upright trunk in a full-depth squat.</li>\r\n<li>They will provide greater stability in all directions with the wider base of the stiffer sole.</li>\r\n<li>They will provide greater stability with stiffer uppers, keeping the foot in place.</li>\r\n<li>They will allow more of the force you produce to go into elevating and accelerating the bar because the hard soles will absorb very little.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAll of these things translate into more weight lifted and less risk of injury. Seems like a good deal to me.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>But I Have Incredible Mobility</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />A pretty typical argument from the resistance is that they already have good mobility and can squat deep without weightlifting shoes. There are usually two problems with this: their depth is nowhere near true full depth (knee joint closed as completely as possible with the back still in its proper arch and weight balanced over the foot) and their posture is suboptimal, i.e. the trunk is inclined forward excessively, or they have to arch the back to an extreme degree to bring the upper back into an upright position.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you truly have adequate ankle and hip mobility to sit into a full-depth, nearly-vertical-trunked squat in flat shoes, that&rsquo;s fantastic and I agree you don&rsquo;t need lifting shoes for the reason of mobility. However, this doesn&rsquo;t address the elements of stability and force transfer that lifting shoes provide&mdash;you can&rsquo;t replicate that with other shoes.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>What to Expect When You Switch</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Here&rsquo;s the tricky thing&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve been snatching, clean &amp; jerking, squatting, etc. in non-weightlifting shoes for a while, you&rsquo;re more than likely going to feel worse initially when you begin using weightlifting shoes. This shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising considering you&rsquo;re changing something quite significant&mdash;like any other change, adjustment and adaptation will be required. An initial adjustment period doesn&rsquo;t mean shoes are making things worse, in the same way that correcting a long-standing technical bad habit will make the lift feel &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; at first.<br />&nbsp;<br />You can expect two things initially: to feel a bit out of balance forward (and/or more pressure on the balls of the foot), and to feel weaker or less comfortable in the squat.<br />&nbsp;<br />The raised heel of lifting shoes will initially make you feel like you&rsquo;re too far forward on your feet. However, this is just because you haven&rsquo;t adjusted yet to position your body properly for balance. Claiming that weightlifting shoes unavoidably create a forward imbalance is like saying no one can stand on a slope without falling. There&rsquo;s no reason, anatomically or mechanically, that you can&rsquo;t balance yourself over your foot however you want in a raised heel, especially when the angle of the foot is so minimal.<br />&nbsp;<br />Your squats may feel weaker or less comfortable during the adjustment period as well for a pretty simple reason: If you&rsquo;ve trained your whole life in flat shoes, you likely have been sitting the hips back somewhat more when you squat, and consequently developed a balance of leg and hip strength that favors the posterior chain to some degree. When squatting in weightlifting shoes and moving in the optimal weightlifting squat posture, you&rsquo;ll be relying more on the quads than you have previously, which will be relatively underdeveloped. Don&rsquo;t lose your mind and get rid of the shoes&mdash;retrain your body to do what it needs to do.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Do You Have to Wear Weightlifting Shoes?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Of course not&mdash;you can train and even compete in any shoes you want (there is no rule in the IWF or USAW that specifically requires the use of weightlifting shoes, although there are some simple requirements).<br />&nbsp;<br />If you&rsquo;re a competitive CrossFitter or Griddler who is sure you&rsquo;ll never wear weightlifting shoes when you compete in CrossFit or Grid, for example, don&rsquo;t wear them in training&mdash;that&rsquo;s a situation in which not using weightlifting shoes is in fact the smart decision. However, it seems to me that you will have opportunities in both to perform big lifts in isolation, as well as lifts within workouts involving elements you don&rsquo;t want weightlifting shoes for; in this case, it would make more sense to train both ways to prepare&mdash;lifting shoes when working on heavy Olympic lifts, and non-lifting shoes when training mixed-mode workouts.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you believe that the positions allowed by weightlifting shoes and promoted by weightlifting coaches are bad for the knees, I encourage you to do some more homework on the topic because this is simply untrue and you&rsquo;re robbing yourself of a lot of gain for no actual benefit.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you just plain don&rsquo;t like the idea and think weightlifting shoes are stupid and funny looking, that&rsquo;s your natural right as a human and I won&rsquo;t interfere&mdash;just don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re doing it for rational reasons.</div>', 19, '2016-12-06', '2116-12-06', 9, 0),
(19, 1, 'Multidimensionality in Weightlifting Programming: Do More with Less', '<div class="article_page_article_image"><img class="article_image" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/2016-10-24-multidimensionality.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div id="article_content">Program design for Olympic weightlifting is one of those things that you either love or hate&mdash;and that feeling can change day to day. One of the toughest things to do is contain a program to effective limits of volume while still addressing all of the needs of the lifter, which may be many and varied. In other words, crafting a training program without throwing in every single exercise you&rsquo;ve ever heard of because you feel like you need all of them, grinding the lifter into a fine dust by day three of week one.<br />&nbsp;<br />Something that always comes to my mind when in this quandary is an article my pal Robb Wolf wrote for the <a href="https://www.performancemenu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Performance Menu journal</a> over ten years ago called <em><a href="https://www.performancemenu.com/article/25/Multidimensionality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multidimensionality</a></em>, in which he essentially described the benefits of relying primarily on exercises that offer a wider array of benefits over those which were more specific and limited in effect.<br />&nbsp;<br />In this case, I&rsquo;m not interested exactly in exercises that provide multiple effects simply for a general sense of doing &ldquo;more&rdquo;, but instead in finding ways to address all of a lifter&rsquo;s needs in a given period without exceeding his or her ability to productively respond to the workload. In other words, to be able to pare down a training program as needed without sacrificing any more than is absolutely necessary.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let me give you a simple example. Let&rsquo;s say we have a lifter who is weak in the drive of the jerk, and also tends to be unstable overhead. If we had our druthers, we might do some jerks, then do a few sets of jerk drives, and then do some jerk supports or recoveries. But what if we legitimately can only do one exercise for the jerk that day? I might do something like a complex of 3 jerk drives + 1-3 jerks and make the lifter hold the split position for 3-5 seconds, and then hold another 3-5 overhead after recovering to a standing position.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>finding ways to address all of a lifter&rsquo;s needs in a given period without exceeding his or her ability to productively respond to the workload. In other words, to be able to pare down a training program as needed without sacrificing any more than is absolutely necessary.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe downside is that we weren&rsquo;t able to load the jerk drives or supports heavier, but we got the jerk drives motion in and also used it before actual jerks to both help practice the motion but also fatigue it somewhat to force more effort in the drive of the jerks themselves, ultimately achieving a similar effect. We may not have been able to overload the supports or recoveries as much as we would have had they been independent of the jerk, but we accumulated a significant amount of stabilizing time, which in many cases is more effective than shorter periods of heavier loads, and also demanded better accuracy in the jerk itself by forcing a hold in the receiving position. If we truly needed heavier jerk drives, we could tack them on to our front squats, which may be that day or another&mdash;simply finishing each set of front squats with 2-3 jerk drives, for example.<br />&nbsp;<br />Complexes like this are the most obvious way to achieve this multidimensionality and knock off multiple training needs with a single exercise. Other examples might be Snatch/Clean Pull + Snatch/Clean, Snatch + Overhead Squat, Clean + Front Squat, Push Press + Jerk, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />But the other method of achieving multidimensionality is actually modifying a single exercise somewhat to address additional elements. For example, if we have a lifter who needs to do some presses for general overhead strength, and who also is weak and/or unstable in the split receiving position, we could have that lifter do presses and something like drop to split, split squats, etc. But if we can&rsquo;t do that, why not just have the lifter do <a href="http://www.catalystathletics.com/exercise/408/Press-In-Split/">Press in Split</a> instead of press? You haven&rsquo;t reduced the effect of the press itself, but you&rsquo;ve added some strength and stability work for the split without adding any time or effort to the training session.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the ideal situation, it would often be best to use multiple exercises to address multiple needs. However, very few of us or our lifters are training in ideal situations. There are numerous good reasons we can&rsquo;t simply add exercises to our program with each new weakness we discover, so some degree of compromise needs to be made. However, rather than compromising by just not doing something at all, we can use a little creativity to integrate this work into what we&rsquo;re already doing, gaining additional benefits without making additional demands on time or recovery.</div>', 44, '2016-12-07', '2116-12-06', 1, 0),
(20, 1, 'Hand & Wrist Position Overhead in the Snatch & Jerk', '<div class="article_page_article_image"><img class="article_image" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/2016-10-17-OHhandposition.jpg" alt="" /></div>\r\n<div id="article_content">Most of the focus with regard to the overhead position of the snatch and jerk is on the shoulders and elbows, justifiably so due to the importance of their positioning and frequency of incorrect positions among lifters. Often overlooked are the positions of the hands and wrists&mdash;but their importance shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated.<br />&nbsp;<br />Before we go further, it would make sense to clarify what the hand and wrist position needs to accomplish even if it may seem obvious in a least a vague sense:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Maintain control of the bar (i.e. keep it in the hand as long as necessary)</li>\r\n<li>Maximize stability (reduce movement of the bar and system overall)</li>\r\n<li>Balance the bar as a part of the whole system</li>\r\n<li>Achieve adequate comfort (i.e. prevent pain and reluctance)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome athletes will achieve these things completely naturally if you put a bar in their hands and tell them to hold it overhead; unfortunately, these athletes are relatively uncommon. For everyone else, there are myriad combinations of poor previous instruction, fear or concern about certain positions, influence of mobility restrictions in the shoulders or thoracic spine (and even ankles and hips), and any number of other factors that can create some surprisingly odd configurations.<br />&nbsp;<br />The analogy I like to make is that we essentially want to mimic the cradle and post of a squat rack with the arm and hand. In other words, we have a strong post and a secure spot for the bar to rest in directly above it. Hold your arm in front of yourself, cup your hand into a U shape (fingers and thumb are the vertical lines and your palm is the bottom) with your thumb in close to a straight angle with the forearm, and that&rsquo;s your basic starting point (see photo below). You should notice that the wrist is extended to angle the palm back, but that the crotch of the hand is over the forearm, not behind it as you would see with extreme wrist extension and a bar placed too far toward the fingers.<br />&nbsp;<br /><img class="articleBodyImage" src="http://www.catalystathletics.com/articles/images/2016-10-17-OHhandposition2.jpg" /><br /><span class="articleCaption">Our starting point for creating the proper hand and wrist position overhead is to mimic the cradle of a squat rack. See the main article photo for a more accurate hand and wrist position with a barbell.</span><br />&nbsp;<br />This is the basic position we&rsquo;re aiming for, which meets a few pretty simple criteria:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Barbell is over the forearm, ideally slightly behind the midline</li>\r\n<li>Wrist is extended (not neutral!), but not completely</li>\r\n<li>Heel of the palm is pointing somewhat toward the ceiling</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou should be able to hold a bar like this without gripping it tightly&mdash;if you have to choke the bar to maintain control of it, your position is incorrect. Excessive grip tension means tension in the elbow flexors, which means slowed and limited elbow extension&mdash;obvious problems in the snatch and jerk. Grip the bar only as tightly as necessary to maintain control&mdash;the proper amount of grip tension will also help maintain the correct position of the hand and wrist (e.g. preventing excessive wrist extension).<br />&nbsp;<br />In the snatch, you can maintain the hook grip through the turnover and into the overhead position <em>only if</em> you can achieve the proper position overhead. The ability to do this is more common in women, who tend to have more slender hands and fingers, better mobility, and are lifting on barbells with smaller diameters of their thicker-barred, stiff, sausage-fingered male counterparts for whom the hook grip will typically prevent the hand and wrist from settling into the correct positions. The latter will need to learn how to properly release the hook grip during the turnover.<br />&nbsp;<br />The position of the barbell relative to the forearm is important for its stability. By placing it over the forearm as opposed to farther bar toward the fingers in an extremely extended wrist, we lose the strength and rigidity of direct support, and you&rsquo;ll begin seeing a lot of softness in the entire overhead position (elbows and shoulders) as a result. By placing the bar very slightly behind the midline of the forearm, we maintain the direct support but gain a little more stability as the bar will always tend to shift in one direction&mdash;rather than being equally prone to move forward or backward if perfectly centered. Again, this is very slight&mdash;the bar remains in the palm and above the forearm.<br />&nbsp;<br />Some new lifters have been taught to hold a &ldquo;neutral wrist&rdquo; overhead (back of the hand in line with the back of the forearm). Typically as athletes progress this corrects itself to some degree because the impossibility of maintaining a neutral wrist with significant weights becomes quickly apparent. But with lifters who are still lifting light enough weights to pull it off, you&rsquo;ll still find it results in a great deal of instability. First, the position is one that needs to be supported and controlled by muscle action overwhelmingly, which means more strain and more movement; with the proper position, the hand and wrist can rely on bony and ligamentous structure for rigidity and stability. Second, a neutral wrist places the bar too far forward relative to the arm. Finally, most athletes eventually find a neutral wrist position, at least with a snatch grip, to be painful.<br />&nbsp;<br />I once commented at a seminar that immobility in the ankles can create wrist and elbow pain and one attendee giggled, assuming I was making one of my incredibly dry jokes that people at my seminars are generous enough to laugh at. However, the rationale is fairly straightforward. Any lack of mobility in the lower body prevents the upper body from achieving the correct position, which prevents the arms from achieving optimal position, which will then force compensation in the positions of the hands, wrists and barbell&mdash;most typically, a barbell placed too far back toward the fingers with an excessively extended wrist and far more force on it due to the extended lever arm created by the rearward placement of the bar.<br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, keep in mind that with all things related to body positions, there will be variation among lifters. Some will be the product of limitations and their consequent compensations, such as more wrist extension and more rearward bar placement to account for poor mobility elsewhere; some will be the product of massive weights that at some point for some lifters exceed what can be controlled and will simply force the hand and wrist into their most extreme positions in which support is created by bone; some will be unable to maintain the ideal position under less extreme weights because of a serious lack of wrist and hand strength; and some will simply have anatomical peculiarities that result in a somewhat different position creating the optimal setup for strength and stability.<br />&nbsp;<br />Use the above guidelines as the starting point and goal, and adjust as needed to account for legitimate needs. For variation caused by correctable issues, get correcting&mdash;work on mobility, strengthen the hands and wrists, and practice the correct position with intent.</div>', 76, '2016-12-01', '2116-12-06', 1, 0),

All your life, you&rsquo;re been taught about hard work. Many of you probably come from family backgrounds where your parents instilled discipline and work ethic into you, right? I know some of you might have been raised in hippie communes where your parents taught you that hard workers were fascists while they dropped acid and knitted their own socks, but those are rare exceptions. The vast majority of us had strong work ethic modeled for us, and we&rsquo;ve developed it into of our personalities as we&rsquo;ve grown older.<br />&nbsp;<br />And there&rsquo;s supposed to be a 2 + 2 = 4 equation here. If you work hard, you get better results. Seems sensible, doesn&rsquo;t it? If you study harder, you&rsquo;ll get better grades in school. If you put more time into developing your business, it&rsquo;ll become more profitable. If you eat right and exercise, you&rsquo;ll have a better body. All of those ideas are pretty solid, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re willing to knuckle down and bust our asses at the things we commit to in our lives. We work hard because we know there will be a better payoff.<br />&nbsp;<br />So&hellip;&hellip;.. now let&rsquo;s talk about Olympic weightlifting.<br />&nbsp;<br />Hard work absolutely does not guarantee you results in this sport. It&rsquo;s entirely possible to dedicate every last drop of energy and commitment in your soul to weightlifting, and still not get what you want.<br />&nbsp;<br />You follow the program exactly the way your coach designed it. You eat right. You get enough sleep. You stretch and work hard on recovery. You study the sport in your off time, watching videos and reading Catalyst Athletics articles to make your mind stronger. You train as hard as you can. You concentrate on your technique. And after all of that, your results don&rsquo;t improve. You don&rsquo;t get any PRs. Sometimes, you actually go backwards and get a little worse for a while. You&rsquo;ve got a 90 kg PR snatch, and you spend weeks unable to hit more than 80 in the gym. Or maybe your technique gets more and more jacked up, even though you&rsquo;re doing everything you can think of to make it perfect.<br />&nbsp;<br />In other words&hellip; you try as hard as you can, but you still get kicked right in the frickin crotch.<br />&nbsp;<br />How about it? Am I hitting close to home? Anybody out there ever experienced this? You&rsquo;ve gotten worse while you were making every effort to get better? I know there are plenty of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; answers to all of these.<br />&nbsp;<br />Fortunately, weightlifters all develop a common set of coping methods. I think it&rsquo;s actually an inherent part of the sport that we all grow into as we spend more and more time in the game. For some reason, we all learn the same methods for how to deal with this kind of difficulty.<br />&nbsp;<br />We scream cuss words. We kick things. We cry. We lash out at loved ones. We get drunk. Really positive behaviors that make everything better, know what I mean?<br />&nbsp;<br />I&rsquo;ll tell you a little story. I won&rsquo;t mention any names, but everybody would know who this person is&hellip; Years ago, I was training in a gym with one of the best female lifters in the country. This gal was one of our all-time greats, and she was also widely known for her sweet, delightful personality. Everybody loved her. She was always in a bubbly mood and I rarely ever saw her without a smile on her face.<br />&nbsp;<br />So we were training together one day and she was having a rotten workout. She missed snatch after snatch, with everybody in the gym trying to cheer for her and encourage her the whole way. Finally, after missing her final lift, she screamed &ldquo;MOTHERF----ING SON OF A B---CH!!!&rdquo; at the top of her lungs, kicked a chair into a wall, and walked outside to cry for ten minutes.<br />&nbsp;<br />Brothers and sisters, it happens to the best of us. No matter how good you are, or how hard you&rsquo;re working, you&rsquo;re still going to have to lick white dog poop every once in a while in this sport.<br />&nbsp;<br />And despite the fact that I&rsquo;ve had some fun and made some jokes in this article about angry outbursts and shaky behavior, I definitely believe that one of your ongoing career projects as a weightlifter should be to control your temper and your failure response. I think this sport attracts hotheads. After 25+ years in the game, I haven&rsquo;t seen too many lame duck personalities in the warmup room at the National Championship. People who go into weightlifting are usually firecrackers, and that means there&rsquo;s always the potential for an explosion if the fuse gets burned down too far.<br />&nbsp;<br />But I also know for sure that the people who really make it to the top in this sport are the ones who can master their own minds as effectively as they&rsquo;re mastered their snatch technique. World Champions have the fire burning inside just like we all do, but they know how to point that fire in the right direction instead of just letting it blaze all over the room and destroy everything when they have a bad day.<br />&nbsp;<br />This article isn&rsquo;t really about figuring out the reasons why our performances can go backwards while we&rsquo;re working and trying as hard as we can. There are a trillion reasons why this could happen, and many times it simply comes down to the fact that weightlifting is one of the hardest sports in the world and nobody gets a free pass. Even if your parents spent your childhood years telling you how you&rsquo;re more special than the rest of us, weightlifting is still going to make you stand in line and suffer just like everybody else.<br />&nbsp;<br />This article is about bringing us all to the same understanding&hellip; that frustration and setbacks are a normal part of the game, and what really matters the most is how you deal with them. We&rsquo;ve all got that instinct inside to blow a gasket when we get discouraged, but your career will go farther if you can keep it under control.</p>', 0, '2016-12-03', '2116-12-06', 6, 0);

Because of the CrossFit explosion that&rsquo;s happened over the last ten years, most cities in this country (and other countries) have multiple gyms where athletes have access to platforms, bumper plates, and bars. All you have to do is pick a CrossFit box gym, and you&rsquo;ve got your weightlifting home. Many people don&rsquo;t realize that it wasn&rsquo;t always like this. Believe it or not, there was a time when OLifters practically had to resort to criminal breaking and entering if they wanted a place to train.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Kara Doherty comes from that time. From the beginning of her career in Canada, Kara learned how to pay her dues with tough training conditions that would drive many lifters to quitting. When she left home to attend college, she had to continue to fight to pursue her weightlifting goals&hellip;simply through battling for a place to train. As she won national championships and rose to the international level, Canada&rsquo;s lack of financial support for weightlifters threw even more challenges in her path. In every stage of her weightlifting life, Kara has encountered obstacles.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>And none of them have stopped her. Her heart and determination have plowed through every difficulty, leading her to an incredible string of successes. Kara is a lifter&rsquo;s lifter, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to deliver her story to you.</div>\r\n<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n<div><strong>Tell us about your background. Where are you from, where do you currently live, what&rsquo;s your occupation (if you work in addition to training), family life, what kind of sports background do you have outside of lifting, etc.</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I am from Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. I currently live in Mountain View, California and train at Catalyst Athletics. I am a part-time personal trainer and a full time mom. :) I started on the Catalyst Athletics staff in January 2010 and in September 2011, I took a hiatus for a little over a year to focus on being a mom. Now I mainly instruct the Catalyst Athletics seminars and help substitute when needed. I also have clients outside of the gym and work with a group of teachers at my husband&rsquo;s high school in San Francisco.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Outside of lifting, I have attempted many different sports but never considered myself to be athletic until I found Olympic weightlifting. I attempted various sports growing up, such as baseball, figure skating, dance, swimming, gymnastics, you name it. I gave them all a fair chance but really enjoyed synchronized swimming and weightlifting the most. I was fairly decent in synchronized swimming, placing in the top tier of my events, but because I was also competitive in weightlifting at the same time, my parents suggested I choose between the two sports. I was involved in several after school activities and two sports and my parents seemed to be spending all their evenings driving me around town. The choice was easy; I loved lifting weights so I chose weightlifting. I enjoyed it more and felt it was a better fit for me. For some reason, I seemed to be drawn to sports not common to most. I mean, who does synchronized swimming and Olympic weightlifting, two sports that are pretty much on the opposite ends of the sports spectrum!? I liked that weightlifting set me apart from everyone else and it was something I was actually good at. I&rsquo;m glad I stuck with weightlifting, as it&rsquo;s been a driving force in my life path. I can&rsquo;t imagine where I would be today if it wasn&rsquo;t for that very important decision.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Describe your weightlifting history. When/how did you start? Who have your coaches been? What championships and international teams do you have on your record? What are your best lifts?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I started lifting in August of 1994 at the Fury Weightlifting Club (named after the 1964 Plymouth Fury car sitting in the garage behind the club). I asked my father, who lifted at the time, if I could come out to watch him lift at &ldquo;the barn&rdquo; (our weightlifting club had 4 platforms in a barn out in the country, quite literally in the middle of nowhere) to see what weightlifting was all about.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>My father had been lifting since he was in high school. When three kids came along, he decided to take several years off of lifting so he could be at home to help my mom. When he felt ready to get back into weightlifting, he continued with his same friends who were still involved in the sport. I had seen my dad compete a couple times when he got back into lifting but didn&rsquo;t show any interest until I was eleven years old. When I asked my dad about lifting, he didn&rsquo;t think I was serious about it because of my heavy involvement in other activities. He told me once I turned twelve that he would introduce me to weightlifting.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>To his surprise, I followed up with my dad the following year. My dad drove me out to the barn and introduced me to Cal Stevenson. Cal coached me through my first workout. I was hooked! I asked when I could come back. I&rsquo;ve never quit since that very day.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I have been coached by several great coaches:</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>My first coach was the late Cal Stevenson. (Sadly, Cal passed in January 2011). Although it was my father who introduced me to lifting, he felt it would be in my best interest if he did not coach me. He didn&rsquo;t want it to cause any tension in our relationship. Cal coached me for a few years until our lifting environment at the barn became so unbearable to train in during the winter because the propane heater broke. It&rsquo;s very difficult to train in -30 degree C weather with 5 layers of clothing on! We were a pretty tough lifting crew, but we had our limits. Believe it or not, the bars got so cold that we would blow torch them to warm them up so our hands wouldn&rsquo;t freeze to them!! We always joked that we should change our club name from the Fury Weightlifting Club to the Flurry Weightlifting Club. Don MacNeil offered to move the club to his home garage (with heat!!!) so we could continue training.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Don MacNeil took over coaching duties for several years until he decided to put his home up for sale, which forced us back to the barn. During this time, I moved eight hours north to Ottawa to attend the University of Ottawa and train from September through May on my own. During the summers, I would go back to my regular training regime at home.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Training in University was probably the toughest training I&rsquo;ve ever endured outside of lifting in -30 C degree weather. I was able to get through it with a lot of self-discipline and determination. It was my competitive goals that kept me on track and my diligence to my program.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I was given special access to train with the University of Ottawa varsity football team, but it wasn&rsquo;t as glorified as it sounds. I basically got access to a key to go train in the basement of the athletic building. I rarely saw any football players in the lifting room, which was an old racquetball court turned into a weight room. They much preferred the spotlight upstairs with the dumbbells vs. the barbells. Eventually my access to the key was restricted unless I had someone to accompany me in the basement. Now you would think it would be easy to find another training partner at a major university in the capital city of Canada, but that was not the case. Luckily I had some really good friends that would accompany me for some of my workouts, otherwise I would have to lie to the front desk and say my training partner was in the bathroom to get access to the key. Luckily, the year after the new rule was put in place, my brother chose to attend the same university. Knowing how important my training was to me, he would attend my workouts. I would plan my training around his school schedule to make it work. Without my brother, many of my workouts would not have been possible. For that I am truly thankful and forever indebted to him!</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Cal and Don both shared coaching duties until I moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado to work for USA Weightlifting at the Olympic Training Center. The late Rodger DeGarmo offered me a position with USAW in 2007 once I completed my Master&rsquo;s Degree in Sports Administration. I jumped at the opportunity to move to the United States and work in my field of study, not to mention train at a world-class facility.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Paul Fleschler, the Men&rsquo;s Resident Coach, took me under his wing and programed for me. Not only was the altitude a challenge to get used to but training <strong>five days a week </strong>was definitely an eye opening experience. In Canada, I had only ever trained three days a week, so the addition of two extra days seemed extreme (let alone hearing that athletes at the training center trained twice daily a few days during the week). I would say it probably took my body a month to get used to this type of training in addition to being less apprehensive about training among the best athletes in the country. I was able to train during my lunch breaks and after work with the Front Range Weightlifting Club.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Greg Everett became my coach when I moved to California and started lifting at Catalyst Athletics. Now I thought I had learned everything I needed to know by the time I moved out to California. I mean, what could Greg possibly teach me after lifting for over a decade??! Greg taught me to look at lifting in a different way. I had never really coached the Olympic lifts before because I was so focused on my own lifting. I never cared to analyze other lifters on the platform or in training. Being around his coaching, and being given the opportunity to coach, has allowed me to learn more in the last five years than the previous years combined. I think Greg was actually the first coach to point out to me that I never released my hook grip in the clean. These are things I never thought about throughout my lifting career. I just did them. Greg has a certain way of explaining things or giving cues that seemed to click with me. Greg challenged me mentally and physically by pushing me in training unlike I have ever done before. He even named my most difficult program after me, called &ldquo;Kara&rsquo;s Nine Weeks of Heaven.&rdquo; If you ever get a chance, you should give it a try! J If you can get through that, you can get through anything. I did my best lifts ever on that program.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Below are the Championships and International Teams I have competed in:</div>\r\n<div>I have been to 14 Canadian National Championships.<br />&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Canadian National Championships:</strong></div>\r\n<div>1997- 59 kg class-Regina, Saskatchewan- 2<sup>nd</sup> place (Women&rsquo;s bar introduced to weightlifting)</div>\r\n<div>1998- 63 kg class-Ingersoll, Ontario- 3<sup>rd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>1999- 63 kg class-Winnipeg, Manitoba- 4<sup>th</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2000- 69 kg class-Vancouver, BC- 1<sup>st</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2001-75 kg class- Collingwood, Ontario- 2<sup>nd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2002-75 kg class- Valleyfield, Quebec- 1<sup>st</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2003-75 kg class- Vancouver, BC-2<sup>nd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2004-75 kg class- Valleyfield, Quebec-2<sup>nd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2005-75 kg class- Regina, Saskatchewan-1<sup>st</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2006-75 kg class- LaPrarie, Quebec-1<sup>st</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2007-75 kg class- St. Thomas, Ontario- 2<sup>nd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2008-75 kg class- La Prairie, Quebec-3<sup>rd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2009-75 kg class- Kelowna, BC-2<sup>nd</sup> place</div>\r\n<div>2011-75 kg class-Toronto, Ontario- 3<sup>rd</sup> Place</div>\r\n<div><strong>International Teams:</strong></div>\r\n<div>2001 Junior World Championships- Thessaloniki, Greece</div>\r\n<div>2002 Junior World Championships- Havirov, Czech Republic</div>\r\n<div>2002 American Open- Savannah, GA, USA</div>\r\n<div>2003 University World Championships- Pavia, Italy</div>\r\n<div>2003 American Open- Atlanta, GA, USA</div>\r\n<div>2004 University World Championships- Maryland, USA</div>\r\n<div>2005 University World Championships-Nice, France</div>\r\n<div>2008 North American Open- AZ, USA</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>My best lifts ever are 90 kg snatch and 107 kg clean and jerk. I currently hold the Ontario Senior Records in the snatch and the clean and jerk. My Ontario Junior records were just recently broken after 12 years of being in the record books. L</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Please give a basic description of your training. Just tell us as much as you can about your program, weekly/yearly planning, etc.</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Currently, I&rsquo;m not on any type of training program. Or as Greg would describe it, I am on the &ldquo;Aimee and Kara training program,&rdquo; which means Aimee and/or I come into the gym (usually 2-3 days a week) and we do whatever exercises we feel like. I on the other hand like to refer to it as the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with that!&rdquo; program. I go into the gym, pick an exercise and work up to a weight that I feel I&rsquo;m happy with for that day. This is not recommended for athletes who want to improve; however, I do feel I&rsquo;m able to maintain a decent level of strength until I decide I want more structure in my lifting or actually have a goal or competition in mind. I decided to take a break from Greg&rsquo;s program after the 2013 American Open. I don&rsquo;t feel it is right to ask Greg to program for me when I don&rsquo;t have any upcoming events in mind. I know it takes a lot of time and effort to put together a program and it&rsquo;s not fair to the coach or myself if I don&rsquo;t follow it through. Greg has already had to modify most of my programs post-baby, as I was not capable of completing the programs to his expectations like I was able to in the past. Greg has been a saint regarding his flexibility and understanding when it comes to training with external demands.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Describe some of the obstacles you face, or maybe some things that frustrate you in your weightlifting life. What kinds of changes would you like to see, either personally or with the sport in general?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I have been fortunate enough to have Aimee and Greg welcome my daughter Kayla into the gym so that I can continue lifting. So as you can imagine, gym life has definitely changed for me. Right now, one of my current challenges is balancing my lifting with being a mom. Focusing on lifting while I am trying to keep an eye on my almost-two-year-old running around the gym entails a whole new level of focus. It can be very stressful at times. She of course is my main priority, so when a diaper needs to be attended to or she is on the verge of a meltdown because it&rsquo;s close to naptime, those situations takes precedence over a perfectly timed set or an additional exercise.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>If you asked me what changes I would like to see in the sport of weightlifting? Canada is still not on the same level as the USA regarding financial support for their elite athletes. This has been an ongoing struggle as long as I can remember. For instance, back when we made an international team, we not only paid for our entire trip but we also paid for our warm ups to represent our country. Funding is also an issue in the US, but until this sport is on the same level as major sports such as football and basketball, we can&rsquo;t expect too much in terms of change.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>What are your plans and goals for your weightlifting career? How do you see your future in the sport? Do you plan to stay involved in weightlifting after your top competitive years are over?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>My first major goal after my daughter was born in 2012 was to make weight for the 75 kg class, qualify for the American Open and compete, all in a span of 5 months post C-section. I was back in the gym 3 weeks after surgery just to move around and do some light bar work. My training regime changed drastically. I couldn&rsquo;t warm up as long as I used to, I was taking longer rest breaks in between sets (and I already was known to take long rest breaks prior to baby!!), my body was slowly getting back to finding it&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal&rdquo; balance again after slowly losing the 55 pounds I gained during pregnancy (yes, you heard that right&hellip;.I was a hefty 100 kg at full term!) and I was stressing out about getting through all the exercises on my program. Needless to say, I was very pleased with my 5<sup>th</sup> place finish.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I currently have no concrete plans or goals for my weightlifting career. I still plan to compete because I enjoy the challenge. Perhaps I will train and qualify for another Canadian National Championships in the near future. For now, I just plan to continue to have fun in the gym and try to keep my strength up.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I have no doubt that I will still be involved with weightlifting when my competitive years are over. It&rsquo;s been such a huge part of my life from lifting, to work, to volunteering (I was on the Ontario Weightlifting Association board, team manager of the 2006 World Championship team for Canada in the Dominican Republic and had the privilege to volunteer at the 1999 Pan Am Games in Winnipeg and 2003 World Championships in Vancouver) and great friendships. Also, my husband, Kevin Doherty, keeps me involved to some degree with his weightlifting team (Hassle Free Barbell Club) as well, so it will definitely be in the family for some time.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Who are some of your major influences, people you look up to, etc.? Who are the people you want to thank for your success?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Some major influences in my weightlifting career were my fellow Fury Club teammates. Seeing them qualify for national and international events was inspiring. They encouraged me to train hard and work for what I wanted. I think that&rsquo;s what made our local club successful, not only provincially, but nationally and internationally as well. The bar was set pretty high, so everyone worked hard and it usually paid off. I also looked up to female lifters like Maryse Turcotte and Jeanne Lassen who made countless world teams and even went to the Olympic Games. I&rsquo;m sure most people would be surprised to hear that I didn&rsquo;t look up to Naim (aka Pocket Hercules), Kakiashvilis and Pyrros Dimas after having a chance to meet with them and being considered quite high on the weightlifting celebrity list at the time, but my weightlifting influences were a bit more realistic.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>I couldn&rsquo;t go without thanking my dad for introducing me to weightlifting, his countless hours with me on the road, driving me to all my weightlifting meets and his endless support. I would like to thank my mother, sister and brother for being such an amazing support system in everything I do surrounding this sport and their ongoing patience and understanding. I would like to thank each and every one of my coaches for all of their knowledge and effort to making me a better athlete. Finally, I would like to thank my husband for being my cheerleader, motivator, and sharing the same love for this amazing sport.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<strong>Weightlifters like you are the ones who make this a great sport, Kara. We&rsquo;re grateful for everything you&rsquo;ve contributed over the years. Best wishes to you and your family as you continue down the road of your lifting life.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</div>', 0, '2016-12-04', '2116-12-06', 4, 1),
